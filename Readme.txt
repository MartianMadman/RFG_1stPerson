Attempts to change the 3rd person view into 1st person. This mod is far from perfect so don't set your expectations too high. Vertical fov is at 43 and Horizontal fov will differ depending on the aspect ratio. Horizontal fovs will be |5:4 = 52|4:3 = 55|16:10 = 64|16:9 = 70|21:9 = 85|. Vehicles remain in 3rd person.

\Install from github/
This mod is made to work with RFG Mod Manager and doesn't need to be packed by the developer to work. To install from github you'll first obviously need to download the repository files. Then download the Mod Manager for RFG which can be found at (https://www.factionfiles.com/ff.php?action=search&pageaction=searchfiles&search_query=mod+manager&file_searchby=7&file_searchgame=3&file_searchcat=&file_sort=5) Use the readme in the Mod Manager download to read up on how to use it. Only the Mod Manager for the original RFG has the readme which is a bit inconvenient. Once done with that, go to the source directory of the 1st Person mod and depending on which version of RFG you use, copy either the Classic or Remaster directory into the mods folder of Mod Manager. Optionally you should rename the directory you copied to 1st_Person after you've put it in the mods folder. At this point you should be good to go and Mod Manager should be able to install it from here.

\Issues/
-Camera view position is off to the right side of the player's head.
-Zoom function on weapons don't work.
-Fov cannot be changed.
